Hello! :)

Let's start learning Lot!

Let's start with the basics. Let's write a "Hello, World" program.

CODE:

	100
	Hello,World!

Done. Now let's learn what variables are.
You can create a variable and name it a or b or c.
Let's create a variable a with the value 10.

CODE:
	200
	a
	10

Great!
We can look at the value of the variable like this-

CODE:
	150
	a

Now it's time to learn what conditions and labels are.
First, let's create a label that will call function 100 (display text on the screen).

CODE:
	800
	100

Now it's time to create the condition. Watch carefully-

CODE:
	200
	a
	5
	200
	b
	5
	700
	a
	b

We have created a condition in which we will compare the values ​​of variables a and b, if they are equal, a transition to the label will occur.

In case you're wondering, 710 is the < operator, and 720 is >. :)

Cycles remain. Cycles in the Lot language are quite simple. Let's create a cycle in which we increase the value of the variable a by 11 units.

CODE:
	200
	a
	0
	500
	11
	a

For convenience, I first reset the variable value to zero.
Let's see the result.

CODE:
	150
	a

You can also generate a random number and load it into a variable.

CODE:
	400
	1
	10
	c
	150
	c

Here we have generated a random number in the range from 1 to 10 into the variable c and printed the value of the variable to the screen.

I think we'll finish here. Thank you all for your attention, study programming, good luck! :)
